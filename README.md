# nfCustomEnvHelper

Having a custom config.fpw and resource files for each project\
is a great convenience to separate  command history, \
startup environment and debug sessions. It also helps to identify\
each open project with their own icon in the taskbar.

nfCustomEnvHelper simply clones your current environment \
( or make fresh ones ) on any folder you choose and \
creates the shortcut on your desktop.

Config.fpw and resource.dbf are saved in &projectfolder\\_customenv\\ ,\
along with startup.prg*, favicon.ico and a copy of the desktop shortcut.\

*startup.prg:
- defines a menu with options to edit config.fpw and startup.prg,\
- sets 2 function keys you might find useful just as a sample:\
 F11 to clear screen/list your current folder\
 F12 to hide all windows and activate screen / go back to previous window when done. \
